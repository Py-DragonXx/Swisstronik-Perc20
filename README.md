# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys a perc20 contract on the swisstronik testnet.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
deploy.js
mint.js
transfer.js
```
